 # 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

 This program is a timed quiz that uses click events to allow the user to answer mulitple choice questions and tallies their results into a high scores page. It starts by displaying a start screen which includes a Start button and a View High Scores button. Upon starting the quiz, the user is presented with a rendered question and a timer, and if they select correctly, they will gain a point and after two seconds, proceed to the next question. Every wrong answer will dock 2 seconds from the timer and render the next question. Upon completion of the quiz, the user is notified that it has ended and they are required to enter their name. Then, they are brought to the high scores page. Using the local storage, the program keeps track of which user(s) complete the quiz and keeps track of the previous scores and orders them highest to lowest, top to bottom. The user can also check the high scores page at any time, and upon closing the high scores page will be redirected to the start of the quiz. The user can choose to clear out the high scores page and start fresh.
